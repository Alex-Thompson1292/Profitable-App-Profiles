# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
This project will analyze apps on the App Store and Google Play markets to try and find apps which are engaging to users. The more engagement by users with ads, the more ad revenue we can generate with our app.
The goal of this project is to identify characteristics within profitable apps, in order to help our developers implement features in our own app to increase user engagement with ads.
